# Contributing to a RealLifeDeveloper Project

First of all, thank you very much for wanting to contribute to this project!

Here is a checklist of things to remember:
- Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
with the changes you want to make.
- Add tests that cover everything you add or change.
- Make sure that the build passes all quality controls by running `mvn -DcheckAll clean install`.

We will make our best to respond to your contribution as quickly as possible.
